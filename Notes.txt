In this project we have to build a Application were we can Book a Hotel ,  The user is going to select the Destination , Date, no. of Guests 
And accordingly we are going to show the hotels to them.
As soon as the user clicks on the Book Button the page will open showing the hotel images and Book option 

And here we also have to design a Admin page where the Admin can see the user Data , add the user and delete the users , add the Hotels  

For the Authentication use the JWT or Passport.JS - This is Necessary
